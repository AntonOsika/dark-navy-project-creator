# dark-navy-project-creator

A dark-themed UI for a web application where users can choose a type of project to create. The page has a dominant dark navy blue color with accent elements in bright red. The page layout is centered with a large heading at the top and a selection input field below it, flanked by navigation arrows. Below the input, suggested project types are listed horizontally, and a prominent red 'Create' button is placed under the project type suggestions. The user's account information is displayed at the top right.
